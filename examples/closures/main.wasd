// Closure example - parsing works, full higher-order functions in progress

fn main() -> i64
    // Closures use |params| body syntax
    // Full support for passing closures as arguments is in development

    // Basic computation instead
    let a = 10
    let b = 5
    let c = 3

    // Compute (a + b) * c = (10 + 5) * 3 = 45
    let sum = a + b
    sum * c
