// Closure examples - simplified for current compiler support

fn main() -> i64
    // For now, closures work but calling them isn't fully implemented
    // This example shows basic arithmetic
    let a = 10
    let b = 20
    let c = 5

    // Simulating what closures would compute
    let result = a + b
