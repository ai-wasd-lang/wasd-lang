REPL - MISSING/INCOMPLETE
=========================

WORKING:
[x] Interactive expression evaluation
[x] Basic commands (:help, :quit, :type)
[x] Type checking
[x] Variable persistence
[x] Simple values (int, float, bool, string)

MISSING:
[ ] Function definitions
    - Cannot define fn in REPL session
    - Would need runtime compilation

[ ] Struct/enum definitions
    - Cannot define types interactively

[ ] Side effects (IO)
    - print() and IO not executed
    - Interpreter only evaluates pure expressions

[ ] Multi-line input
    - No continuation for incomplete expressions

[ ] Type display improvements
    - :type command output incomplete
    - Generic types not shown clearly

[ ] History persistence
    - No readline/history save between sessions

[ ] Tab completion
    - No autocomplete for identifiers

[ ] Loading files
    - :load filename.wasd to import code

[ ] Compiled mode
    - Currently interpreter-based
    - Could JIT compile for speed
