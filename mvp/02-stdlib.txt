STANDARD LIBRARY - MISSING/INCOMPLETE
======================================

Runtime library (runtime/wasd_runtime.c) provides:
[x] Vec - dynamic array with push, get, set, len, clear, capacity
[x] HashMap - hash map with insert, get, contains_key, len, clear

Type signatures in src/stdlib/ need to be updated to match runtime.
Use extern fn declarations for now to call runtime functions.

CORE (std.core):
[ ] Option methods (map, and_then, unwrap_or, etc)
[ ] Result methods (map, map_err, and_then, etc)
[ ] Ordering comparisons

COLLECTIONS (std.collections):
[x] Vec - implemented in runtime/wasd_runtime.c
[x] HashMap - implemented in runtime/wasd_runtime.c
[ ] HashSet - not implemented
[ ] BTreeMap - not implemented
[ ] BTreeSet - not implemented
[ ] VecDeque - not implemented
[ ] LinkedList - not implemented

STRINGS (std.string):
[ ] String concatenation runtime

[ ] BufRead/BufWriter
[ ] Seek trait

FILE SYSTEM (std.fs):
[ ] File handle implementation (relies on C FFI)

[ ] Temp files

NETWORKING (std.net):

[ ] Structured concurrency runtime

PROCESS (std.process):
[ ] Command builder
[ ] Process spawning
[ ] Pipes

TIME (std.time):
[ ] Instant - not implemented
[ ] Duration - not implemented
[ ] DateTime - not implemented

THREADING (std.thread):
[ ] Thread spawn
[ ] Join handles
[ ] Thread-local storage

SYNC (std.sync):
[ ] Mutex - not implemented

[ ] Barriers/Condvars - not implemented

RANDOM (std.random):
[ ] RNG implementation

ITERATORS (std.iter):
[ ] Iterator trait runtime
[ ] All adapters (map, filter, etc)
[ ] All consumers (collect, fold, etc)
