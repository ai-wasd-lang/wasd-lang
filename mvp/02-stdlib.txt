STANDARD LIBRARY - MISSING/INCOMPLETE
======================================

All stdlib functions are TYPE SIGNATURES ONLY.
Actual implementations need to be written or linked from C.

CORE (std.core):
[ ] Option methods (map, and_then, unwrap_or, etc)
[ ] Result methods (map, map_err, and_then, etc)
[ ] Ordering comparisons

COLLECTIONS (std.collections):
[ ] Vec - only signatures, no actual dynamic array
[ ] HashMap - not implemented
[ ] HashSet - not implemented
[ ] BTreeMap - not implemented
[ ] BTreeSet - not implemented
[ ] VecDeque - not implemented
[ ] LinkedList - not implemented

STRINGS (std.string):
[ ] String concatenation runtime
[ ] String slicing
[ ] String searching/splitting
[ ] Case conversion
[ ] Trimming
[ ] Format interpolation runtime

IO (std.io):
[ ] Read trait implementation
[ ] Write trait implementation
[ ] BufRead/BufWriter
[ ] Seek trait

FILE SYSTEM (std.fs):

[ ] Directory operations
[ ] Permissions
[ ] Temp files

NETWORKING (std.net):
[ ] TcpStream - not implemented
[ ] TcpListener - not implemented
[ ] UdpSocket - not implemented

[ ] Command builder
[ ] Process spawning
[ ] Pipes

TIME (std.time):
[ ] Instant - not implemented
[ ] Duration - not implemented
[ ] DateTime - not implemented

THREADING (std.thread):
[ ] Thread spawn
[ ] Join handles
[ ] Thread-local storage

SYNC (std.sync):
[ ] Mutex - not implemented
[ ] RwLock - not implemented

[ ] Barriers/Condvars - not implemented

RANDOM (std.random):
[ ] RNG implementation
[ ] Distributions

MATH (std.math):
