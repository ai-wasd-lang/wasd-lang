TYPE SYSTEM - MISSING/INCOMPLETE
=================================

[x] Trait registration and impl checking
    - register_trait stores trait info with methods
    - check_impl verifies all required methods are present
    - Error on missing trait methods

[ ] Trait bounds checking
    - "where T: Add" syntax parsed but not enforced
    - Need to check bounds at generic instantiation

[ ] Struct type registration
    - register_struct is minimal stub
    - Field type validation incomplete

[ ] Trait method binding
    - No return type checking for trait impls
    - No self parameter validation

[ ] Associated types
    - Syntax may be parsed but not resolved
    - type Output = T inside traits not working

[ ] Const generics
    - Array[T; N] where N is compile-time constant
    - Not implemented

[ ] Refinement types (v2 feature)
    - type Positive = i32 where self > 0
    - Not implemented (spec says v2)

[ ] Newtype wrapper validation
    - newtype UserId(u64) distinct from u64
    - May not be fully enforced
