CODEGEN - MISSING/INCOMPLETE
=============================

WORKING:
[x] Basic LLVM IR generation
[x] Function declarations
[x] Integer/float operations
[x] Struct types
[x] Stack allocation
[x] Heap/RC/Arc allocation instructions
[x] C library FFI calls

MISSING/INCOMPLETE:
[x] While/for loops codegen
    - Fully implemented with break/continue support
    - IR lowering in stmt.rs, LLVM codegen in terminator.rs

[ ] Full enum variant construction
    - Tagged unions need runtime support

[ ] Full pattern matching codegen
    - Complex patterns may not lower correctly

[ ] Generic monomorphization at codegen level
    - Type-level works
    - LLVM instantiation may be incomplete

[ ] Struct field access codegen
    - README lists as "in progress"

[x] Closure capture codegen
    - Environment capture via lambda lifting
    - Captured variables passed as extra parameters
    - Tested with multiple closures in same scope

[ ] Async/await runtime
    - Syntax parsed
    - No actual async execution

[ ] RAII / Drop codegen
    - defer statement
    - Automatic cleanup on scope exit

[ ] Panic / unwinding
    - Stack unwinding on panic
    - Or abort mode
